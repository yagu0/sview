<h1>sview : tiny PHP web framework</h1>

<p>
	It is inspired by <a href="http://shortphp.com">a similar framework</a> written by Arnór Heiðar Sigurðsson. 
	In the same spirit but more advanced and more complete, see also <a href="http://nanoc.ws/">nanoc</a> - in Ruby.
</p>

<p>
	sview is designed to organize essentially static websites. 
	It does not offer the features you would expect from a complete MVC framework - 
	actually, it has only the "V" part. 
	If you want a more demanding dynamic website, consider using an appropriate tool, 
	<a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> for example.
</p>

<h2> How to use it ?</h2>

<p>
	The archive sample-website.tar.xz provides a basic but full website example. 
	Complementarily, the file <a href="http://git.redua.net/?p=sview.git;a=blob_plain;f=README.html;hb=HEAD">HOWTO.html</a> 
	gives some details about sview usage.
