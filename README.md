# sview : tiny PHP web framework.

It is inspired by [a similar framework](http://shortphp.com) written by Arnór Heiðar Sigurðsson. 
In the same spirit but more advanced and more complete, see also [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/) - in Ruby.

sview is designed to organize essentially static websites. 
It does not offer the features you would expect from a complete MVC framework - 
actually, it has only the "V" part. 
If you want a more demanding dynamic website, consider using an appropriate tool, 
[Symfony](http://symfony.com/) for example.

## How to use it ?

The documentation is [right 
here](http://git.redua.net/?p=sview.git;a=blob;f=HOWTO.md;hb=HEAD), 
and a full website example is [located 
here](http://git.redua.net/?p=sview.git;a=blob;f=sample-website.tar.xz;hb=HEAD).
